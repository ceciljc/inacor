It has a form of kind of eagle, whichh is the mythical golden eagle, common to both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. The Garuda was a chimera, having the wings, beak, and feet of the golden eagle, but a man's arms and trunk. The use of the Garuda in Indonesia's National Symbol invokes the pre-colonial Hindu kingdoms that spanned across the archipelago, from which the present-day Republic of Indonesia is understood to be descended.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa (Belief in the one and only God)</li>
                    <li>Kemanusiaan yang adil dan beradab (Just and civilized humanity)</li>
                    <li>Persatuan Indonesia (The unity of Indonesia)</li>
