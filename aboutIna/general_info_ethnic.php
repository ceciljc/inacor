                <p>There are around 300 distinct native ethnic groups in Indonesia, and 742 different languages and dialects.  The largest ethnic group is the Javanese, who comprise 42% of the population, and are politically and culturally dominant. The Sundanese, ethnic Malays, and Madurase are the largest non-Javanese groups. There are also Papua ethnic, Balinese, Dayak ethnic and many more.</p>
                <p>Society is largely harmonious, although social, religious and ethnic tensions sometimes could triggered uneasy situations. However it has always been handled properly. Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising 3–4% of the population. However, the fact is much of the country's privately owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-Indonesian-controlled. Chinese businesses in Indonesia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.</p>
